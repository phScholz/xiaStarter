************************
xs0.4 to xs0.4.1
************************

"MCA Run"-tab:

	- Timelimit for fixed-time MCA run was increased to 86400=3600*24
		

************************
xs0.3.6 to xs0.4
************************

Gerneral:

	- scope and mb_sample are now implemented
	- scope button is enabled
	- Fixed Bug which produced a segmentation fault at the start of the program (linking to NULL pointer)

"Listmode Run"-tab:

	- new check box called "terminalCheck" is now available; once this check box is checked the collector will be started in a xterm; so one can see the stdout of the collector during the run
	- if terminalCheck is checked, the kill and the stop button will now get the pid of the collector via "pidof" and write it into a file ~/.xs/pidCol; XiaStarter will then read the pid out of the file and initiate a kill process for the collector before the xterm process will be killed
	- running the collector in xterm and killing it can cause problems with the daq: just reboot and re-setup the daq will help to overcome this problem!
	
"Listmode View"-tab:

	- the "viewTemp"-file will be now also stored in the ~/.xs/ directory 
	- Fixed problem with hdtv
	- bool-variables for hdtv and tv of the xiaStarter-class are now initalized in the constructor of the xiaStarterWindow-class
	- "view latest two"-button will now be disabled during the copy of mca files


************************
xs0.3.5 to xs0.3.6
************************

General:

	- removed residual dgf_show output ... is now only visible if "debug" is defined

"Rates-Plot"-tab:

	- limit of for-loop was reduced to ratestime.size()-1 in order to get rid of the error that the last element of rates.at(j).at(i) does not exist

"Listmode View"-tab:

	- experimentator can now choose between tv and hdtv 


************************
Patch xs0.3.4 to xs0.3.5
************************

General:

	- dgf_show output is now written to qDebug() if "debug" was defined
	- all scripts will only be written to qDebug() if "debug" was defined
	- more qDebug() messages are now only visible if "debug" was defined
	- rates will now be updated every second
	- rates will now be written into the <Runnumber>.rates-file every 1000 seconds
	- added Date to the log-output: "[date|time] text" 

"Rates Plot"-tab:

	- fixed ratestime bug; rates will only be plotted if there are at least three data points
	- the ratesPlot will now only show the last 1000 seconds of data

"Info"-tab:

	- version number has been removed

************************
Patch xs0.3.3 to xs0.3.4
************************

General:

	- fixed crash bug by applying security changes to all <vectors> (Problem: ratestime.size() still exists but won't lead to crashes now)
	- new dgfConfig-widget
	- new function to visualize the last two subruns of a detector
	- implemented button for the scope program ... still not functional
	- getRates() will now be called every 5 seconds
	- after the ratestime.size() becomes greater than 1000, xiaStarter will start to store the rates in a file <RunNumber>.rates in the specific rates folder
	- after once the xiaStarter has been started it will create a file witin the home directory ".xs" - this is just a temporary file which will be deleted by closing the xiaStarter
	- "xiaStarter -fs" will start xiaStarter with "force start", i.e. it will ignore the ".xs" file
	- starting xiaStarter normally it will show a MessageBox if there is still a ".xs"-file in the home directory

"Listmode View"-tab:

	- new button "view last two subruns" is functional now and will show a Messagebox where the user can choose which detector he/she wants to see

************************
Patch xs0.3.2 to xs0.3.3
************************

General:

	- deleted unnecessary functions startClock(), writerStdOut(), collectorStdOut(), collectorStarted()
	- cleaned up source code
	- fixed bug that the new preference settings are only available for the first ten detectors

"Listmode Run"-tab/Listmode Run:

	- fixed bug that the rates haven't been updated if one has started the collector before the writer

	- added menu which pops up if there is a rightclick on the diagram to let the user choose which rates should be visible and which not (user has to adjust the detectorType before)


"MCA Run"-tab/MCA mode: 

	- fixedTime mca mode will now also start mb_mca_start and not mb_mca anymore; the time interval is now controlled via a QTimer called mcaTimer which calls the slot mcaClock() every second;
	- the mcaStartButton and the mcaTimeBox are not enabled after one has activated the "Start"-button in fixedTime mode until the "Read out"-button has been activated
